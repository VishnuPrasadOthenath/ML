Steps - performed

•	Initial data inspection and data cleaning:
o	Check whether the data has duplicates, missing values, irrelevant (erroneous entries) values, or outliers.
•	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:

o	Use appropriate visualizations to find out which two albums should be recommended to anyone based on the number of popular songs in an album.
o	Perform exploratory data analysis to dive deeper into different features of songs and identify the pattern.
o	Discover how a song's popularity relates to various factors and how this has changed over time.
o	Comment on the importance of dimensionality reduction techniques, share your ideas and explain your observations.

•	Perform Cluster Analysis:
o	Identify the right number of clusters
o	Use appropriate clustering algorithm
o	Define each cluster based on the features
